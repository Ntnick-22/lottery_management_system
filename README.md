passwordApp
I used instantiable classes for this App
PasswordApp handles all of the data test cases and user input .
I used the scanner to get the user input 

I used the simple logic 
Do /while for the whole loop.
Inside the big loop it has some loops to accept all the user inputs and has some while if the input not valid .
This class will infinitely run with do/while until user not type the yes option.
PasswordGenerator
I used the PasswordGenerator class  to handle the password creation logic.
  I used the stringbufer in my compute method.
I used simple steps in the compute method to remove every nth character, replace spaces with  special character, add 'R' before vowels, uppercase consonants in the surname, and append the length.
 I also added a method checkExpiredPasswords to validate passwords using basic conditions like length and special characters.
